Metrics That Matter
• Time to detection
• Time to remediation and/or patch
• Baseline security posture, how close are you to your goals? How much closer 3, 6, 12 months later?
• Are you meeting your SLAs with developers and ops?
• Average number of vulnerabilities per system or app, and does this go down over time?
• Detecting the same types of vulns? Reduction in #s?
• Are you now able to detect new types of vulns?
• After education on specific topics do instances decline?
• After targeting specific vulns do they decline?

Incident Metrics That Matter
• Time to resolve
• Time to detect
• Time to diagnose as incident or just event (triage)
• Types/categories of incidents
• Process is/is not followed
• Cost & damage
• Types repeated, or new types found
• Other teams understand what to do/cooperative
• Post-mortem performed *every single time*?
• Quarterly review of incident stats
• Time between incidents (if there’s no recovery time that’s an issue) – Note on resting your staff
• Access and tooling was/was not available
